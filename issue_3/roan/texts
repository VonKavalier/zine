What could be a motivation to learn python?
What is so powerfull in being able to write the famous "code"?
What is a need that I have that can be covered this way?

----

Empathy

----

empathy
can be thus understood as an
interface
between us and
emotions

----

After a long history of struggling with anger,
Anger as a struggle,
Monoculture of anger

I discover that there are other emotions possible.
It is only a question of tuning my aparatus inward instead of outwards. 

----

emotion
is an
interface
for the
affect

----

Coding affect into a text-based interface "is like dancing architecture".
The possibility of affect lays not within the interface or the machine.
It is a part of the reader that is transferred upon the interface and then taken back by the reader.

 The key is not to confuse the finger
 with the moon.

 The role of language is to point towards
 and not to fully embrace.

 There is always a risk of following the finger in a way that it creates
 an ultimately diferent reality.

 Power is to be found in shifting realms.
 This is where "I can" is learnt.

 Maybe the transiting is itself more real
 than any fixed image given at
 particular time.
