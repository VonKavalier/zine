"A Distillation Of The Feeling You Get When The Realization Washes Over You That We Have 12 Years To Prevent A Global Climate Catastrophe And That There Exists Some Point At Which Climate Change Will Be Irreversable As Methane Melts Out Of The Permafrost Up In Siberia And That The Biggest Polluters Aren't Individuals, They're Corporations, And Being Corporations They Are Driven Only By Profit For The Capitalist Class And That We Cannot Keep Earth Inhabitable Unless We Come Up With Some Completely Different Economic System And Reformat Modern Life As We Know It"
