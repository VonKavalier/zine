Hardware Store

----------------------------

weekend projects have a difficulty
metric unseen and rooted at their core
loosely based on know-how but more important
by number of trips to the hardware store

a simple project like hanging a shelf
can be done simply in just less than two
a harder project is hanging a shelf
when you're missing a drill bit or screw
