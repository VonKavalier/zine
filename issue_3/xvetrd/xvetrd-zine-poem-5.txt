High Again

----------------------------

lets get high
and listen to that cassette
i got for free
by emailing a nude

(mine was #21)
i got it that summer my mom got
cancer, remember?
i got high when i first listened to it too

and i don't even smoke.
i listened to it "wrong"
it was pitch "corrected"
all the way down, slowed too,

so i had more time.
it was mostly instrumental
so there wasnt a vocal problem
i listened with my over-ears

and sat on the ground.
i fell asleep
and was taken away
away from everything.

im high again
and listening again; slowed, again
and i want to be away again
gone again
