### a poem you can run ###
##########################

maybe "i will build my own meaning, aloft dreams of greater desire"
maybe "the will to live on will strike me fast and quick"
i "can't quite see what's ahead of me"
yet "feel like it might be fine"

although

maybe "i will find my flights of fancy to be idle and obscene"
maybe "distraction will only hinder my wellbeing"
i "don't want to be a bother"
yet "i know that i'm not alright"

although

maybe "i will make it seem alright to others"
maybe "the esscence and odor of self-loathing will be masked with an alluring veneer"
i "can't let them know what a struggle it is to wake up"
yet "i'll miss more things if i keep on dragging my feet"

although

maybe "it would be best if I just didn't try at all"
maybe "the reason i keep on letting people down is letting myself hope"
i "don't feel like there's much left to lose"
yet "there's nothing else to gain"

although

maybe "someday my problems will evaporate into air like steam"
maybe "the reason for the stress and anxiety and sadness will become clear"
i "revel in the absurdity of existence"
yet "recoil in fear of losing purpose"

although

maybe "i will build my own meaning, aloft dreams of greater desire"
