~rogbeer's (re-)collection of quotes

### Pre-amble

"Everything that needs to be said has already been said.
But because no one was listening, it has to be said again."

Or so goes a quote that I remember reading within the last ten years.

The following are my attempts to see if I can glean some wisdom from
people who are from a segment of society that I think have been
under-represented in some way or another; I ask myself, what can I learn from
these people, whose voices I may not usually encounter on an everyday basis?

for a break in the conversation."
